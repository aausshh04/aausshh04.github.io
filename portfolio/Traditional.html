  <p>The medium I used for this art is a 32lb 60x36 inch paper and used different ranges of graphite pencil. This is a project I did for my art class in 2018. It is one of my core theme that I love working. This work was pretty challenging and it was the first large self portrait I did. I am not so much of a self-portrait guy but this project was pretty fun to tackle.</p>

   <p>I do not often use color on my works as I mostly use graphite but when I was looking at some wild life documentary the beauty of this feral being made me want to portray it in my canvas and I had to use color to marvel its beautiful color. </p>

      <p>I have done tattoo designs in the past and this was something that just came to my mind as I was carelessly playing with a paper and a pencil. I decided to make an art that I can use for my self as a tattoo. And this is the product of my imagination and a representation of my emotions that were flowing while I  was creating it.</p>

       <p>The first time I listened to Linkin Park blowed me away and it was like I had found something filled with such grace and power. The leadsinger "Chester Bennington" had a voice like no other and is remembered as one of the greatest metal and rock singer that lived. Linkin Park became my favourite band since 2002. Their music have so much impact and the beauty of the lyics and composition are unparalled. This is an artwork that I created as I listened to their songs using graphite and ball pen and I plan to use it on jeans jacket. </p>
        <div><img src="img/rob.jpg" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:0"></div>
        <p>This is an artwork that I exhibited in Nepal for relief for earthquake victims. This was a charity event where artists sell their work and help those who were victims of the earthquake that devistated the entire nation in 2012.</p>
