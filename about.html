            <h1>About My Art Style</h1>
            <p> My Name is Ayush Shrestha and I mostly work on traditional art.

              My artwork explores the relationship between my curious nature and by those which bring excitement to me and enhances my creativity making me want to vision them through my own creativity and make them look entirely different but have similar essence. 

Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated by the beauty of creation and all started with sketches that I was given to do in my kindergarten. That was my door to becoming an artist. My inspirations do not come from great artists like Michelangelo, Monet or Picasso but rather from those modern artists that depict life and art in various forms; mostly anime, tattoo designs and photography. My relation to art can be described as my voice and my emotions pouring out as I lack expressing them physically. My art has always showed my emotion through every degree; joy, anger, sadness and happiness. 

  The medium I use most is graphite. I have had most interest in using graphite all my life. It gives me the earthy feel of it exploding on my paper as I push it and the feeling of lightness as I softly glide it over my canvas. The most often graphite I use is 10b, 8b, 2b and hb. These give me a wide array of techniques to make different kind of art. But with time I have been exploring with different medium. I have switched to water color pencil to give my work more vivid color and expressions and also been lately involved in photography and use of digital software which combined with my traditional style gives a different sense of beauty in my art.

  I love exploring the different medium of art with new art style coming it makes me more excited to explore them and try them and see what fits me more and synthesize the different art styles to create my own style. This is a core of my art.
