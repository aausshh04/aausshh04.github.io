  <p>I was taking some shots for my friends work and she had this ring that she was working on with for her business and as I saw it ideas came to my mind and I started to explore the possibility of what I can do with this silver chameleon ring which is fascinating just to look at so I decided to put it on a cactus and give it a touch of its natural habitat. </p>
  <div><img src="img/god.jpg" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:0"></div>
   <p>This is a portrait of the God 'Swet Bhairav' located in Basanatpur, Kathmandu, Nepal. It is a historic and religious figure situated in the heart of the city a very beautifully carved statue of the diety who is known as a diety of the Rain God 'Indra'. It is a beautiful work of art which no one can resist to admire and i fell one of its victim and had to capture its essence through my lens.</p>
  <div><img src="img/1.jpg" style="width:50%;height:50%;border:0"></div>
  <p>This is a picture I took in North Beach, San Francisco a year ago. It was a beautiful moment at dawn.
  I used my phone to capture this shot as I was going for my daily walk which I love to do near the beach. i used some effects and filters from photoshop too enhance its beauty.</p>

    <p>Making 3d work was always fascinating for me and I got to learn how to use it in my class for which I am grateful towards my teaccher for showinh me a glimpse of the 3d world. This is a work that I did for my class for my 3d project.</p>

   <p> When I was using p5js I was very amazed what it could do and something clicked in my mind. The joy of pokemon and how I used to love it as I grew watching it on Cartoon network every day before I go to school and play it on my gameboy so I decided to make a little tribute to pokemon from where it started to where it is now.</p>
